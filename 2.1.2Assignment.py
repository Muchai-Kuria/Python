#+=  operator is used to add and assign the value of y to x. It means that it adds the value of y to x and then assigns theprint("x is",x)print("x is",x)print(x+y) # 30
x +=y
print("+=",x)
#^=  ^= means bitwise XOR assignment operator. It performs a bitwise exclusive OR operation on the variable and the value (rhs), and # 30 # 30 # 30    
x =10 
x ^=y 
print (x)
#&=  and |= operators are used for bitwise AND and OR operations respectively.
x =10
x&=y
print(x)
#>>= operator is used to shift the bits of number x to right by y positions.
x= 10
x >>=y
print(x)
